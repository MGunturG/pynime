# PyNime
A (simple) Python3 script to scrape GoGoAnime.

ToDo:
- [x] Restructure code base to using class code base
- Make downloader
- Play on player like mpv or vlc
- Get top current airing anime

I am not making this to able search by genre, knowing popular anime (all the time/top ranking anime), and so on. Main purpose of this script are "I want to watch anime on my installed video player on my computer.", that's it.

I just wanna make it simple as possible. If you wanted anime recommendation go to anilis, myanimelist, or Reddit (r/AnimeSuggest and others).

Project still on working progress, not finnished yet. But, the code is working fine, feel free to grab a piece of the code.
